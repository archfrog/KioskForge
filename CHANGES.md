# KioskForge Change Log
This document presents the important changes made to each KioskForge release from v0.18 and onwards:

## 2025.04.25, v0.18
1. The KioskForge setup program now includes a change log of changes made to KioskForge.  It is shown by the installer for v0.18+.
2. The vacuuming of logs on the target kiosk machine now actually works (a lowercase 'm' was changed to an uppercase ditto).
3. The HTML documentation is now quite a bit prettier than before.
4. Added detection of, but not support for, Ubuntu Desktop/Server 25.04 so that KioskForge gracefully fails on these.
5. Made the detection logic more robust in preparation for detecting numerous future Ubuntu releases.
